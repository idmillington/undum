        <h1>Situations</h1>
        <p>
          In Undum, all interaction takes place in a situation. You
          can think of it either as a 'Room' in traditional
          interactive fiction (although it is less flexible than
          that), or as a 'Page' in a Choose Your Own Adventure book
          (though it is more flexible than that). At any point in
          time, the character is in exactly one situation, and that
          situation is responsible for everything that happens to
          them. Situations are chunks of code that generate the output
          you are reading here. For example, this text was generated
          by the <em>enter</em> method of the first situation.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="s_saving">
        <h1>Saving and Loading</h1>
        <p>The only piece of the UI we haven't talked about is the
          'Save' and 'Erase' buttons on the left panel. These are only
          visible if your browser supports client-side data
          storage. Clicking 'Save' stores your game, so you can pick
          it up again later. There is currently no 'Load' button, the
          game loads when the page loads. There is also no way to save
          multiple games, and select which one you want to play. These
          are both things I'd like to change in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potentially your game could generate huge amounts of
          text. And that would be difficult to store client side
          (there are unpredictable limits), especially when we move
          towards having multiple save files. So instead Undum saves
          your character as the list of links you clicked. Loading a
          save-file consists of playing through your game again,
          quickly. This is a beneficial approach for debugging too. It
          means when you're polishing and correcting typos, you can
          save and load the game and scroll through the transcript to
          see your corrections. If we saved the text, your save file
          would have the error in it and you'd have to manually replay
          the game to see the correction.
